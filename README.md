Simple AI Website
A project by Tanner Kopel

For this project I created a really easy website with the ability to order a custom AI.
The cool thing about this website is the demo ai featured on the home page. Simply click the red button on the bottom right and say a command, and the AI will respond.
Other than that, the other pages were just used to practice my css, and don't have much functionality.
On the plans page, you can view the multiple subscription plans available when ordering an AI assistant.
On the order page, you can fill out the short custom order form, and it will put you through the checkout process for buying your custom AI.
PLEASE NOTE: YOUR PAYMENT INFORMATION WILL NOT ACTUALLY BE RECORDED, AND AN AI WILL NOT ACTUALLY BE ORDERED. THIS WEBSITE IS PURELY TO PRACTICE MY WEB DEV SKILLS, AND IS NOT MADE FOR ACTUAL BUSINESS OR PURCHASING.

I hope you enjoy this project!
